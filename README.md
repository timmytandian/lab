# Lab Repository

## About This Repository
This repository serves as a collection of hands-on labs and sandbox projects for learning and experimenting with new technologies. It includes various exercises, tests, and explorations across different fields of technology.

## Purpose
The purpose of this repository is to document and organize my learning journey through practical experiments and projects. Whenever I want to start a new project, this repository can become a good starting point (I can simply copy-paste part of files in this repo).

## Contents
This repository is organized into folders, each representing a specific technology or project. Some examples include:
 - Cloudflare: contains hands-on projects to learn Cloudflare cloud technologies (e.g. Cloudflare Worker)
 - nodejs: includes code to learn JavaScript and NodeJS in general
 - python: includes code to learn programming in python
 - rust: includes code to learn programming in rust
 - terraform: contains hands-on projects to learn Infrastructure as Code using Terraform

## About Git Submodules
Some folders in this repository are managed in other git repository, so I add them as submodules. Here are the submodules that I have.
 - nodejs/alphabetShifter
 - terraform/terraform_devopsdirective_demo
